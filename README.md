# unrealcv-playground

This is a minimal project to show the usage of unrealcv.

It helps the development and debug of unrealcv.

This is a c++ project. UnrealCV is included as a submodule, so that it is easy to do development and debugging.
The submodule is currently from qiuwch/unrealcv. Need to switch it to unrealcv/unrealcv
