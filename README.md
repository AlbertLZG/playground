UnrealCV playground is a minimal Unreal Engine (UE4) project to demonstrate how to use UnrealCV. It also helps the testing of UnrealCV.

This UE4 project is modifed from FirstPerson shooter template of UE4, all its digital contents belong to original authors.

This project is still under construction. Relevant tutorial and scripts will be added gradually. 

This is a c++ project. UnrealCV is included as a submodule, so that it is easy to do development and debugging.

The submodule is currently from qiuwch/unrealcv. Need to switch it to unrealcv/unrealcv
